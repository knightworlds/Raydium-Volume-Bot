## Getting Started

### üìã Environment Variables

The bot uses the following environment variables. Rename the `.env.copy` file to `.env` and set the necessary variables.

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=                 # Private key for the main wallet
RPC_ENDPOINT=                # RPC endpoint for Solana
RPC_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT=      # RPC WebSocket endpoint for Solana

####### BUY SETTING #######
BUY_UPPER_PERCENT=60         # Higher percent limit of SOL that can be used to buy token in wallet
BUY_LOWER_PERCENT=30         # Lower percent limit of SOL (30 means, it buys with larger than 30% of SOL in wallet when buy)

BUY_INTERVAL_MAX=30          # Upper limit of seconds to wait after second buy
BUY_INTERVAL_MIN=2           # Lower limit of seconds (it waits from 2 to 30 secs after second buy before second buy)

SELL_INTERVAL_MAX=30         # Upper limit of seconds to wait after sell
SELL_INTERVAL_MIN=3          # Lower limit of seconds (it waits from 2 to 30 secs after sell to transfer SOL)

DISTRIBUTE_WALLET_NUM=4      # Number of wallets that run in parallel which makes volume (max: 20)

SLIPPAGE=50                  # Slippage in percent

TOKEN_MINT=                  # Mint address of token to increase volume

## Key Differences Between the Previous and Updated Versions


### üö´ Limitations of the Previous Version

- ‚ùå **Repetitive Buy & Sell on a Single Wallet**: The old version relied on fixed wallets for buy/sell actions, which made it easy to spot repetitive transactions on DexScreener.
- ‚ùå **No Increase in Makers**: It only increased trading volume without adding new makers to the pool, limiting the overall liquidity impact.
- ‚ùå **Token Gathering without Selling**: In the past, leftover tokens were simply gathered to the main wallet without selling them, leaving unnecessary token balances.
- ‚ùå **Equal Number of Buys and Sells**: The strategy of matching buys and sells created sell pressure after each round of trading, potentially impacting the market negatively.


### üöÄ Improvements in the Updated Version

- ‚úÖ **Automated SOL Transfers to New Wallets**: After completing a buy and sell cycle on one wallet, the bot automatically transfers SOL to a new wallet and continues trading there. This increases the number of unique wallets involved in the trading process, making the volume appear more organic.
- ‚úÖ **Increased Pool Makers**: The new version creates a fresh wallet after each round of buying and selling, contributing to a more substantial number of market makers and increasing liquidity.
- ‚úÖ **Selling Tokens Before Gathering SOL**: The bot now ensures that any remaining tokens are sold before gathering, preventing unused tokens from accumulating in the wallet. This strategy also reclaims token account rent fees (0.00203 SOL).
- ‚úÖ **More Buys than Sells**: The updated bot executes two buys for every sell, creating buy pressure by increasing the number of buy transactions compared to sells. This results in more favorable market conditions.
