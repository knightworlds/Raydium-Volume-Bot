## Key Differences Between the Previous and Updated Versions


### üö´ Limitations of the Previous Version

- ‚ùå **Repetitive Buy & Sell on a Single Wallet**: The old version relied on fixed wallets for buy/sell actions, which made it easy to spot repetitive transactions on DexScreener.
- ‚ùå **No Increase in Makers**: It only increased trading volume without adding new makers to the pool, limiting the overall liquidity impact.
- ‚ùå **Token Gathering without Selling**: In the past, leftover tokens were simply gathered to the main wallet without selling them, leaving unnecessary token balances.
- ‚ùå **Equal Number of Buys and Sells**: The strategy of matching buys and sells created sell pressure after each round of trading, potentially impacting the market negatively.


### üöÄ Improvements in the Updated Version

- ‚úÖ **Automated SOL Transfers to New Wallets**: After completing a buy and sell cycle on one wallet, the bot automatically transfers SOL to a new wallet and continues trading there. This increases the number of unique wallets involved in the trading process, making the volume appear more organic.
- ‚úÖ **Increased Pool Makers**: The new version creates a fresh wallet after each round of buying and selling, contributing to a more substantial number of market makers and increasing liquidity.
- ‚úÖ **Selling Tokens Before Gathering SOL**: The bot now ensures that any remaining tokens are sold before gathering, preventing unused tokens from accumulating in the wallet. This strategy also reclaims token account rent fees (0.00203 SOL).
- ‚úÖ **More Buys than Sells**: The updated bot executes two buys for every sell, creating buy pressure by increasing the number of buy transactions compared to sells. This results in more favorable market conditions.
